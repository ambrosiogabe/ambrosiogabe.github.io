Hi! I'm Gabe.

I'm just an average programmer at an average corporate job with a passion for game development and teaching. You can check out my YouTube channel linked to the left for some tutorials or devlog style videos, but I'll try to include written forms of the same content plus any other things I decide to blog here.

I'll mainly be blogging about C++, some Java here and there, game development, and other random techy article stuff. You can find older articles by clicking older on the home page, or appending `/page/:num` to the URL, where `:num` is just some number to go back in time to. At the moment there's only 3 pages, so `/page/3` would take you to the oldest articles.

Hope you enjoy!
