Below is an unfiltered recounting of my dangerous opinions on the matter. Proceed with caution.</p> <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2> <p>Bob Martin starts off with a lengthy discussion about what “clean code” <em>is</em>. In this lengthy discussion he doesn’t discuss any verifiable metrics that can determine whether a piece of code is “cleaner” than another piece of code.

Font rasterization is the process of converting a vector description to a raster or bitmap description. In other words, font rasterization is converting mathematical formulas to pixels on the screen you are using. We use this process everyday when we use our phones, but have you... <hr/> </div> <div class="post"> <div> <a href="/games/2020/04/16/on-cameras-in-opengl/"><img src="/public/images/openGlCameras/titleImage.jpg"></img></a> </div> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="/games/2020/04/16/on-cameras-in-opengl/"> Cameras in OpenGL </a> </h1> <span class="post-date">16 Apr 2020</span> <p>A feature that almost every game has and uses is a camera.

If you have, then you know how hard it is to continue to motivate yourself. When you are in school, you have teachers that take up homework and give you a bad grade if you don’t finish on time.

Sometimes, concepts can get lost in translation when two communities are speaking to each other. These communities can be Computer Science professionals, teachers, firefighters, etc. Each one of these has their own distinct terminologies that can only be understood within the context of that community.

A list is a data structure that holds a number of items that you can access in constant time. The advantage of a list in comparison to an array is that a list expands or shrinks as needed, so there is no need to know the number of elements in advance.
