They're in varying levels of completion. I probably won't touch most of these again, so whatever state they are in is the state they'll most likely remain for the rest of their life. Each project has it's own Github repository with instructions on how to use the given project. </p> <p> The way that the list below is styled is as follows: </p> <p> Each project starts with the project name, then under that is the percentage complete. These are rough estimates, and if a project says it's 100% complete that does not mean it's flawless, it just means I'm probably never going to touch it again. Then, there's a picture that shows a little bit of what the project looks like. </p> <p> If you are not a programmer I will try to include less programmer friendly ways to try these projects so you can still use them too :) </p> <br/> <div class="projects"> <article class="post"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="https://github.com/codingminecraft/Mario" target="_blank"> Mario Maker in Java </a> <i class="fab fa-github" style="margin-left:2%"></i> </h1> <tt> [==============] ~ 100% Complete</tt> </header> <p> I decided to expand upon my learning from the Geometry Dash game I made, and made an even more complicated engine. I switched to LWJGL so that I could handle the rendering myself, which resulted in a 20% increase in CPU speed and about 1% increase in GPU speed. I was really proud of the improvements, and the engine got some massive upgrades as well.

I wanted to make the entire engine from scratch and really formalize my game-making skills, so I decided to code Geometry Dash in Java. I began to implement an AI for the game using the NEAT algorithm, however I never quite got it working right.

It looks a bit like Javascript, but behaves more like Python, and it is incredibly slow right now. I have it coded in Java right now, and it just walks an AST to interpret the code you write.

It was coded in Javascript and HTML/CSS, and it was built from the ground up by following a tutorial from a book that introduced me to programming.

I followed a tutorial for this, but added in several of my own components. It's a pretty fun game, but it only works on Windows right now. I may eventually add support for Mac and Linux. It was built in Unity and I used open source assets for all the images.

I decided to put everything I had learned into practice and release an App available on the Google Play Store. I used Unity Ads to try and monetize it. The premise of the game is simple, tap the screen to flip the character and go for as long as possible. </p> <img src="/public/assets/images/flipping_gravity.png"/> </article> <article class="post"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/Poker" target="_blank"> Poker </a> <i class="fab fa-github" style="margin-left:2%"></i> </h1> <tt> [=========] ~ 100% Complete</tt> </header> <p> I was perusing problems on <a href="https://projecteuler.net/" target="_blank">Project Euler</a> one day and stumbled across a problem that asked to determine who wins a game of Poker. This will be fun I thought... and it was :). I finished the problem which simply fed in a feed of Poker hands in a .txt file and asked you to determine who won. After I finished I realized I had a Poker game in the making. So I went the next step and made it a game. </p> <img src="/public/assets/images/Poker.png"/> </article> <article class="post"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/DjangoTestDrive" target="_blank"> Djnago Test-Drive </a> <i class="fab fa-github" style="margin-left:2%"></i> </h1> <tt> [==========] 100% Complete</tt> </header> <p> This one is a project I had to complete for a class at school.

This is like the "Hello world!" of game programming. I don't know how many different versions of this I have made. This particular version was made in Java using Swing and AWT. I have a simple AI that tracks the ball and has a certain percentage of error that it will have depending on the difficulty you chose. The paddles initialize as random colors and the ball changes to the color of whichever paddle it hits. </p> <img src="/public/assets/images/pong.png"/> </article> <article class="post"> <header class="post-header"> <h1 class="post-title"> <a href="https://github.com/ambrosiogabe/Quadtrees" target="_blank"> Quadtrees </a> <i class="fab fa-github" style="margin-left:2%"></i> </h1> <tt> [==========] 100% Complete</tt> </header> <p> Quadtrees are an interesting data structure used in some 2D game engines to help with the collision detection. The premise is that it is implausible to test collisions against every single object with every other object in a game. So what Quadtrees do is break up the gameplay space into several different sections so that you only have to test the objects nearest to each other for collision. Unfortunately I never implemented this in any of my game engines. </p> <img src="/public/assets/images/quadtree.png"/> </article> </div> </div> </div> </body> <script type="text/x-mathjax-config">
