Background
==========

This is one of the first games I programmed in Java. It is not my first game, I have created several. But, whenever I begin game coding in a new language, or using a new platform, Pong is always a fun start-up. You will notice that the game is quite glitchy and the AI is not the best, but it was a simple two day build to get whet my appetite. I hope you enjoy this little build and I hope it inspires you to go create some games of your own! Have fun!
