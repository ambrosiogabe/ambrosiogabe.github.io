Here's a game that I coded from scratch. Follow the download instructions below to install on your computer.

Instructions
============

There are a couple of download links below. In order to install the game, first download both the links and save it to your desktop. IMPORTANT: You must save both files to your desktop or it will not install correctly.

Next, unzip the main.zip file, and make sure that you have a file called main on your desktop. After that, click the ImpossibleGameInstaller.jar and follow the download instructions. Once it has completed you should have a shortcut to the game on your Desktop. Feel free to delete the download files and enjoy the game!

Note: I did not come up with the idea for The Impossible Game, all credit to the idea goes to the creators of the original, World's Hardest Game. My game is simply a remake using my own artwork and code and style. Thanks!
