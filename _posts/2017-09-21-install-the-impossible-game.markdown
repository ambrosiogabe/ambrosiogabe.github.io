Here's a game that I coded from scratch. Follow the download instructions below to install on your computer.

Instructions
============

Download and unzip the `Main.zip` file linked below, then double-click or run the jar from the command line :)

Note: I did not come up with the idea for The Impossible Game, all credit to the idea goes to the creators of the original, World's Hardest Game. My game is simply a remake using my own artwork and code and style. Thanks!
