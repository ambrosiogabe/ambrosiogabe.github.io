Download
========

My first app! It's been awhile, and I just finished a big course in Unity and developing apps, it was a great course and taught me a lot. You can download the game for the app on google play [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.Gabe.FlippingGravity&hl=en), and I will release it on the Apple Store in the future. In the mean time, here's a limited version for PC.

Windows
=======

You can download the game here at [itch.io](https://gamesbygabe.itch.io/flipping-gravity).

Screenshots
============

Here are some screenshots to see a little bit of what the gameplay is like.
